# Onyx-MiscFixes

Miscelaneous fixes for some small base game bugs and problems.
Everything can be toggled off individually

- Option to rebind open chat button (anything other than enter will not clear chat window, idk how to fix this)
- Option to rebind open Consoel button (requires enableconsole)
- Fixed Tooltip sometimes being in the wrong position
- Fixed Artificer Nanospear and Nanobomb firing twice
- Fixed Magmaworm attack hitbox sometimes floating way above the actual attack area, making it undodgeable
- Unlocked zoom out to allow zooming out as far as on a 4k Display
